# Applications of partial rejection sampling
This repository includes various Python programs that simulate partial rejection samplings in different settings.

In particular, partial rejection sampling can be used to uniformly generate *w*-free substrings and *H*-free subgraphs.

For theoretical results and conjectures related to these simulations, see 
["Uniform Generation of *w*-free Strings and *H*-free Subgraphs with Partial Rejection Sampling"](https://math.mit.edu/research/undergraduate/spur/documents/2018Gil-Amaniampong.pdf).
